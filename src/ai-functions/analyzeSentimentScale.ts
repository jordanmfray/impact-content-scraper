You are analyzing an article about "${organizationName}" to determine organizational sentiment and relevance.

SENTIMENT SCALE:
-1: Organization is mentioned NEGATIVELY (criticism, scandal, negative impact, problems caused by org)
 0: Organization is NOT MENTIONED or only mentioned in passing/context
 1: Organization is mentioned but NOT the main focus (brief mention, quoted source, etc.)
 2: Organization IS the main focus and article is INFORMATIONAL (facts, updates, general news about org)
 3: Organization IS the main focus and article is about their SOCIAL IMPACT (inspiring stories, impact work, positive change they're creating)

ARTICLE TITLE: ${title || 'N/A'}

ARTICLE CONTENT:
${content}

ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Look for direct mentions of "${organizationName}" in the content
2. Determine if mentions are positive, negative, or neutral
3. Assess if the organization is the main subject or just mentioned in passing
4. For score 3: Look for evidence of social impact, positive change, inspiring stories, beneficiaries helped, etc.
5. For score 2: Informational content about the org (leadership changes, financial reports, general updates)
6. For score 1: Brief mentions, quotes from org representatives, or context mentions
7. For score 0: No meaningful mention of the organization
8. For score -1: Negative coverage, criticism, scandals, or problems

Be STRICT with scoring:
- Only use 3 if there's clear evidence of INSPIRING SOCIAL IMPACT content
- Only use 2 if the org is clearly the MAIN FOCUS but it's informational
- Use 1 for mentions that aren't the main focus
- Use 0 if there's truly no meaningful mention
- Use -1 only for genuinely negative coverage
